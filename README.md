# EGG-Lighting-Test
I develop this project with Javascript, CSS and HTML. To run this project, you have to clone the repository and then double click to the index.html.
A decision I made that is worth mentioning is that Bored API does not give a route path to contribute from a different domain but only from its website, so I decided to reverse engineer the javascript code of the website. Finally, I found the route, and I developed a contributing form on my site. Hopefully, cors policy did not prevent me from doing this action.
